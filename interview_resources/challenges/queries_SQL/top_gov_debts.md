# Top 3 Average Government Debts

**Verbatim Challenge:**

"You are given a SQL database with the following table full of data:

CREATE TABLE countries ( code CHAR(2)
NOT NULL, year INT NOT NULL,
gdp_per_capita DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT
NULL, govt_debt DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT
NULL );

Please write the SQL statement to show the top 3 average government debts in percent of
the gdp_per_capita for those countries of which gdp_per_capita was over 40,000 dollars in
every year in the last four years."

## Solution

- Open a db in workbench -> open new SQL tab and run the given script (you could also create an ERD with this table but running the SQL is less work, more direct, and less room for human error)

  - ``` SQL
      CREATE TABLE countries (
          code CHAR(2) NOT NULL,
          year INT NOT NULL,
          gdp_per_capita DECIMAL(10 , 2 ) NOT NULL,
          govt_debt DECIMAL(10 , 2 ) NOT NULL
      );
      ```

- Add a variety of data so that it will be clear if your query works
- Create a checklist

  - ``` SQL
      /*
          Please write the SQL statement to show the
          [ ] top 3 average government debts
          [ ] in percent of the gdp_per_capita
          [ ] for those countries of which gdp_per_capita was over 40,000 dollars
          [ ] in every year in the last four years.
      */
      ```

- Start by checking off the easiest requirements & auto format your code: Edit -> Format -> Beautify Query (Ctrl+B)

1. `[x] for those countries of which gdp_per_capita was over 40,000 dollars`

    - ``` SQL
      SELECT
          code, year, gdp_per_capita, govt_debt
      FROM
          countries
      WHERE
          gdp_per_capita > 40000
      ;
        ```

2. `[x] top 3 average government debts`
    - **Google**: "mysql select top"
    - will find out `TOP` is a keyword but MySQL uses `LIMIT` instead

    - ``` SQL
        SELECT
            code, year, gdp_per_capita, govt_debt
        FROM
            countries
        LIMIT 3
        ;
        ```

3. `[x] in every year in the last four years.`

    - could easily hard code the year that is 4 years before the current year into the `WHERE` clause, but then the query will be wrong after the new year
    - **Google**: "mysql select recent years"
    - `DATE_SUB(NOW(),INTERVAL 1 YEAR);` may be found, but doesn't seem to work, maybe because our db is storing only the year and not a full date
    - the search results probably also displayed `MySQL YEAR() function - w3resource`

    - ``` SQL
        SELECT
            code, year, gdp_per_capita, govt_debt
        FROM
            countries
        WHERE
            gdp_per_capita > 40000
                AND YEAR(NOW()) - year <= 4
        LIMIT 3
        ;
        ```

4. `[x] in percent of the gdp_per_capita`
    - When in doubt (which is the numerator?), **Google**: "government debt in percent of gdp"
    - **Google**: "mysql percent from two columns"

    - ``` SQL
        SELECT
            code,
            year,
            gdp_per_capita,
            govt_debt,
            (govt_debt / gdp_per_capita) * 100 AS 'Gov Debt-to-GDP ratio'
        FROM
            countries
        WHERE
            gdp_per_capita > 40000
                AND YEAR(NOW()) - year <= 4
        ORDER BY "Gov Debt-to-GDP ratio" DESC
        LIMIT 3
        ;
        ```

    - `ORDER BY` is not working, try with another column
        - it works, what's different?
        - the column's name we are trying to `ORDER BY` is a string
            - **Google**: "mysql order by string column name" or "mysql order by column name with spaces"
              - "Try enclosing them in back-ticks like" ``ORDER BY `Full Name` ASC``
                  - ``ORDER BY `Gov Debt-to-GDP ratio` DESC``
