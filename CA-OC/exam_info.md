  - **UPLOAD** exam before your time runs out

## PLAGIARISM

- You can repurpose / edit learn platform code, stack overflow, or lecture code to make it work for you, HOWEVER if you copy paste LARGE amounts of code **without any changes**, that is considered **plagiarism**. Students have been **EXPELLED for plagiarism.**
- Other examples: cloning entire online repos of a past students exam, sharing exam code with other students, etc. We have had to expel students for these violations as well.

## COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR INSTRUCTOR

- depending on class size, instructor may want to grade your exam with you right as you finish

### DM Instructor When

- Finished and ready for us to check it (double check it before messaging us)
- If you get really stuck, depending on the problem we may give you a hint

## What to focus on

- For all stacks except Web Fund: **focus on functionality and red belt requirements first**, do not spend a lot of time on CSS, until you have everything working

---

## Use a Checklist To Track Completed Requirements & For Testing

- check off each requirement when completed
- any time a change is made near the end, go through the checklist again testing each requirements and checking it off to make sure nothing broke what was working before

## Web Fund

### HTML & CSS Exam (**OPEN BOOK** - NO Helping Each other)

- **use a color picker**
- most important thing is the overall layout / alignment
  - focus on getting this down before the small details like gradients, etc.
- keep developing on same window size to avoid different sizes breaking your layout
- use [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/) & [css validator](http://www.css-validator.org/) (by file upload or direct input)
- **don't worry about the upload a video demo requirement**, if you want, you can take a screenshot of your website when it's finished and upload that instead
- difficulty will be similar to these assignments:
  - Portfolio
  - About Python

## MERN

- **BEFORE** uploading or zipping and emailing (to reduce file size):
  - **DELETE** the `node_modules` folder in your back end
  - **DELETE** the `node_modules` folder in the front-end inside your `client` folder
- You can recreate your `node_modules` later if needed by running `npm i` on the `server` level **AND** the `client` level
