# Django 2.2 Cheat Sheet

- **windows**: do this once: ctrl+shift+p -> select default shell -> Command Prompt

---

## Follow EVERY step carefully!\*

---

## **_!!!Copy & Paste commands - REPLACE `{{text}}` with your chosen names (REMOVE CURLYS)!!!_**

1. open terminal to where you want your project folder to be created
2. `mkdir {{your_project_name}}`
3. `cd {{your_project_name}}`
4. activate the python environment that Django is installed in
   - **windows (use cmd)**: drag and drop the `activate` file from environment folder into cmd terminal and press enter
   - **mac:**: type `source` (<-don't forget the space) into your terminal then drag and drop the `activate` file and press enter
   - your terminal should now show `(your_env_name)`
5. `django-admin startproject {{your_django_proj_name}} .` **<- don't forget the period**
   - `.` will make it so there's only one folder with the {{your_django_proj_name}} instead of also having an inner folder with the same name
6. type `code .` to open VSCode to `{{your_project_name}}` folder
   - if `code .` doesn't work, open VSCode to `{{your_project_name}}` manually
     - to make `code .` work next time: `cmd + shift + p`, then type `shell command: install 'code' command in PATH`
7. open integrated VSCode terminal `ctrl + ~` or from `View` menu drop down
   - integrated terminal should show `(your_env_name)` because it auto activated environment
     - if environment is not activated, drag and drop the `activate` file into VSCode terminal
8. `python manage.py startapp {{app_name}}` to make a new app with it's own folder (adding `_app` as a suffix to the name can help make the folder structure clearer)
9. Add your app in `settings.py` which is in `{{your_django_proj_name}}` folder
   - add _`'{{app_name}}',`_ to the 0 idx (top) of `INSTALLED_APPS` **list** (**don't forget the comma**)
10. `urls.py` inside `{{your_django_proj_name}}` folder

    - ```py
      # from django.contrib import admin
      from django.urls import path, include

      urlpatterns = [
          # path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
          path('', include('{{app_name}}.urls')),
      ]
      ```

11. create `urls.py` in `{{app_name}}` folder

    - ```py
      from django.urls import path
      from . import views

      # NO LEADING SLASHES
      urlpatterns = [
          path('', views.index),
      ]
      ```

12. create following folder structure in `{{app_name}}` folder
    - `templates`
      - `index.html`
13. `views.py`

    - ```py
      from django.shortcuts import render, redirect

      def index(request):
          return render(request, 'index.html')
      ```

14. `python manage.py runserver`
    - see Debugging Notes below for additional setup steps if you want additional debugging tools

## Select linter to get rid of false underline errors (one time only per environment)

- `ctrl or cmd + shift + p` -> type `Python: Select Linter` -> select `pycodestyle`
- also install `autopep8` formatter if prompted to benefit from auto format

## When reopening vscode

- vscode needs to be opened to the `{{your_project_name}}` folder so it detects the virtual environment
- **if terminal doesn't show `(your_env_name)`:** press the **`+`** icon on terminal
  - if environment still has not activated, re-do the select python interpreter steps and then press **`+`** icon on terminal again

## App flow walkthrough: Re-read this until you know it by heart

1. _Request_ is made from a URL being visited via:
   - typed into address bar
   - anchor tag
   - `<form>` submitted triggering `POST` _request_ to URL in `action` attribute
   - `return redirect` from `views.py`
2. URL is compared to the `urls.py` file to see if it matches any of the urls in the list of urls
3. When URL is matched, it runs the specified view function, passing any URL parameters to the view function. The view function needs a parameter for each of the URL parameters using the same parameter names.
4. view function gets data from the database if needed and sends that data to the right template (HTML) to display the data, **_OR_** the view function `return redirect` to another URL
5. Whatever the view function returns is the _response_ which finishes the _request_ _response_ cycle.

- the _request_ and _response_ can be seen in the network tab of chrome dev tools

---

## Route Parameters / URL clarifications

---

### `urls.py` - NO LEADING SLASHES

- `path('users/<int:user_id>', views.user_profile, name="users_profile"),`
- this is to MATCH a _requested_ URL in order for django to know which view function to route to when a URL is requested so that the proper _response_ can be given to the client
- `<int:id>` is a PLACEHOLDER for whatever integer will be located at that section of the URL
  - it is a route parameter, just like a function parameter, it will store the value that is passed in when the url is visited just like a function parameter will store the value that is passed in when the function is executed
  - e.g., `http://localhost:8000/users/15` - `15` is the value of route parameter `user_id`
- when this url is visited, the `user_profile` function in `views.py` will be executed and it MUST have a corresponding parameter with the same name as the route parameter: `def user_profile(request, user_id)`

---

### When are values inserted into urls?\*

- when a client types in a url

---

#### HTML files

- in `html` files you generally have **leading slashes on your urls**
- in `<a>` tags
- in `action` attribute of a `<form>` tag
- the above are all places where you will use jinja to insert the actual value that you want `user_id` to have
- `<a href="/users/{{ user.id }}">`
- `<form action="/users/{{ user.id }}/update" method="POST">`

---

#### `views.py`

- you generally have **leading slashes on your urls** here
- when you `return redirect(f'/users/{some_id}')`

---

## Terminal Commands

---

### `python manage.py runserver`

- stop debug mode if it is on
- this command will auto reloading server on code changes which is useful for when you are making many changes

---

### Migrating

1. `python manage.py makemigrations`
2. `python manage.py migrate`

---

### Shell

1. `python manage.py shell`
2. `from {{app_name}}.models import *`

---

### Source Control - Only when you need to add to github

- create a `.gitignore` file with the below code so these files/folders are not added to github:

  - ```txt
      .vscode
      env/
      venv/
      __pycache__/
      .vscode/
      db.sqlite3
    ```

- `pip freeze > requirements.txt` with `env` active to create a file that lists installed packages (dependencies)
- when repo is cloned / shared
  - create env
  - activate it
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install everything required

---

## Django MTV (Model Template View)

- the view retrieves data from the database via the model, formats it, bundles it up in an HTTP response object and sends it to the client (browser).
- In other words, the view presents the model to the client as an HTTP response.

## Prefill date from db into input box

- chrome console gives an invalid format warning when trying to insert a value that is not formatted in this way

1. ```html
   <input value='{{entity.birthday|date:"Y-m-d"}}' />
   ```

2. ```py
   def edit_show(request, show_id):
       selected_show = Show.objects.get(id=show_id)
       context = {
           'selected_show': selected_show,
           'formatted_release_date': selected_show.release_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
       }
   ```

   - `<input value="{{ formatted_release_date }}" type="date" name="release_date">`

## Debugging Notes

---

### One time setup per project to be able to use breakpoints

- Select python interpreter

1. Windows: `Ctrl+shift+P` Mac: `Cmd+shift+P`
2. Type: Python: Select Interpreter
3. Select the one with the path to your environment folder
4. Click debug icon in vscode side bar (bug icon `Ctrl+shift+D`)
5. click "**create a launch.json file**" link or gear icon
6. select python
7. select django
   - `launch.json` will be created - ok to close it. Can delete if you need to re-do this step.

---

### To Debug with breakpoints (won't auto reload on code changes)

- **Stop server** `ctrl + c` then press play button in debug panel or press F5
- add a breakpoint by clicking to the LEFT of the line number so that a red circle appears
- everywhere you add a breakpoint, your app will pause running on this line until you use the debug control panel to continue
