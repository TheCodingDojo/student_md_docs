- ``` css
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
    ```
  - add this to the top of your external CSS file for every assignment
  - this selects everything (`*`) and removes all margin and padding, which means you will have to add margin everywhere that you want it. It's more work at first, but it is easier to maintain in the long run and you have more control.
