# Basic Algos

## Function Example

### Define the function

- ``` js
  function addTwo(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
    ```

  - `num1` is the name of paremeter 1, `num2` is the name of parameter 2
  - parameters are placeholders for the actual values that will be passed in to the function when it is executed

### Execute the function

- ``` js
  var sum = addTwo(5, 10);
    ```

  - `5` is argument 1, `10` is argument 2
  - arguments are the actual values that are passed in to the function when it is executed
  - `num1` will have the value `5` and `num2` will have the value `10`
  - `var sum = addTwo(5, 10);` returns the result of the addition and assigns that result into the `var` named `sum`

## Basic Algos

1. Print integers 1 through 100
2. Print integers 1 through 100 backwards
3. Print integers evenly divisible by 5 that are between 1 and 100
4. Function: **combineStrings** - Given 3 strings, concatenate then return the strings in this order: 3rd string, 1st string, 2nd string
5. Function: **combineSmallerStringFirst** - Given 2 strings, concatenate them together with the smaller string in the front and the longer string in the back and return the result
    - If the strings are the same length, concatenate the first string at the beginning.
6. Function: return the sum of a given array of integers
7. Function: **stringRepeat** - Given a string and an integer (`n`), return one string that is the combination of the given string repeated `n` times
8. Function: Given an array of integers, create and return a new array that has only the even integers
    - use `nameOfArray.push(itemToAddToBackOfArray)` to add items to array
9. Function: Given an array of integers, print the average of only the odd numbers
10. Function: Given an array of integers, replace negative numbers with the string / word `"negative"` and positive numbers with the string `"positive"`
11. Function: Given an array of integers, return the sum of the min and the max values
12. Function: Given an array, swap the first and the last items
13. Function: Given an array and an integer, return a count of how many integers are less than the given integer
14. Function: Given a start integer and a stop integer, print integers from the start (inclusive) to the stop (inclusive)
15. Function: **loopAndMultiply** - Given 3 numbers, n1, n2, n3 - return the sum of n2 times n3 after n1 iterations
Function: **distanceDriveable** - Calculate and return total miles that can be driven before running out of gas, what info do you need to answer this?
16. Function: Given an array, shift each item to the right 1 index, replace the first item with 0
